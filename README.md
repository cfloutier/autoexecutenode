# Auto Execute Maneuvre Node

The first tool of the C.O.S.M.A.T : Computerized Onboard Spacecraft Mission Assistance Toolbox

This is my first plugin into ksp2. For the moment it only execute the next maneuvre node.
There is no use of the SAS for the moment (very early version). The pilot, wait for a good pointing, do auto-warp and auto-burn.

All of those phase must be enhanced. It's quite working bettern tahn I can do by hand but could me more precise. especially the burnign phase. there is always some small amount of dv Missing...

 I would like to make more of them in the future :
- Docking and Rendez vous assistant.
- Auto Landing and , kill vertical or horizontal speed
- Auto Ascent.
